Prior to coding, I had a few thorough rounds of reading through the task to make sure I fully understood the task. 

Having chosen JS with which to complete the task (being the package I am most comfortable with), I thought I would first need to install node and express to create a server.
I then thought that saving the csv data would involve creating and array of objects, separating the objects using split() selecting comma as the delimiter. I thought I would then
need to link this to an index.html page that ultimately displays the data.

Starting out and through the project I struggled to find a way to manipulate the interactions data in a way that I could produce a unique list of entries selecting by sector_id, and 
finding the sum of all entries, after producing percentage scores for number of entries per sector based on total entries. My workaround here was to
first clean and sort the data in excel before pulling it to the app.js.

To improve the app, I would need to find the problems that are preventing the index.html page from pulling in the TableCSV data. I also need to find a way to sort the data and produce a list of unique entries with a count per entry type, after producing percentages for them each
as requested in the Tech Test. 

Another improvement would have been to find to allow the user to filter data on the page. I imagine I would need to make several arrays, and create get requests that will pull data based on the users choice.
